Of course! A good README is essential for any project. Here is a friendly, comprehensive, and well-structured README.md file tailored specifically for your "Super Secure Calculator" project.

You can copy and paste this content directly into a README.md file in your project's root directory.

🧮 Super Secure Calculator

Welcome! This isn't just any calculator... it's a Super Secure one! This project is a full-stack web application featuring a modern FastAPI backend and a responsive React frontend, all neatly containerized with Docker.

The application provides a robust user authentication system and a simple, secure way to perform and save calculations. It's built as a boilerplate and learning tool for modern web development practices.

✨ Features

Secure User Authentication: JWT-based login and registration.

Full User Management: Create, read, update, and delete users.

Profile Management: Users can view and update their own profiles and passwords.

Calculation History: Users can perform calculations and view their history.

Interactive API Docs: Automatic, interactive API documentation via Swagger UI.

Fully Containerized: The entire stack (backend, frontend, database) runs in Docker for easy setup and deployment.

Database Migrations: Uses Alembic to manage database schema changes.

🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern and powerful set of technologies:

Area	Technology
Backend	FastAPI, Python 3.10, uv, Alembic
Frontend	React (with Vite), Axios, Nginx
Database	PostgreSQL
DevOps	Docker & Docker Compose
🚀 Getting Started

Getting the project up and running is simple, thanks to Docker.

Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
git clone https://github.com/your-username/super-secure-calculator.git
cd super-secure-calculator

Create the environment file:
Copy the example environment file to create your own local configuration.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
cp .env.example .env

Now, open the newly created .env file and customize the variables. At a minimum, you must set a POSTGRES_PASSWORD and SECRET_KEY. The provided defaults are fine for local development.

Build and run the application:
Use Docker Compose to build the images and start all the services in the background.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
docker compose up --build -d

--build: Forces a rebuild of the images, which is useful when you change Dockerfiles or code.

-d: Runs the containers in detached mode.

You're all set!
The application is now running. You can access the different parts of the stack at these URLs:

Frontend Website: http://localhost:3000

Backend API: http://localhost:8080

Interactive API Docs: http://localhost:8080/docs

Database Admin Tool (Adminer): http://localhost:8081

🔧 Environment Variables

The .env file is used to configure the application. Here are the key variables:

Variable	Description	Example
POSTGRES_SERVER	The hostname for the PostgreSQL container. Should be db.	db
POSTGRES_USER	The username for the PostgreSQL database.	postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD	Required. The password for the PostgreSQL database.	supersecretpassword
POSTGRES_DB	The name of the database to use.	app
SECRET_KEY	Required. A secret key for signing JWTs. Generate a strong random key.	your-super-secret-key-here
FIRST_SUPERUSER	The email for the initial superuser account created on startup.	admin@example.com
FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD	The password for the initial superuser account.	changethis
BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS	JSON list of allowed origins for CORS. Crucial for the frontend to work.	["http://localhost:3000"]
FRONTEND_PORT	The port on your host machine to expose the frontend website.	3000
BACKEND_PORT	The port on your host machine to expose the backend API.	8080
